 This package provides shims for Debian service and system management commands.
  * chkconfig, invoke-rc.d, update-rc.d, deb-systemd-invoke
 .
 The shims simply invoke native service management commands.
 .
 It satisfies any packages that depend from init-system-helpers in order to obtain these commands.
 .
 This chkconfig is a shim for the original IRIX command of that name, and thus is not syntax compatible with the chkconfig found in non-Debian-related Linux-based operating systems such as CentOS.
