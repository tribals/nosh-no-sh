 This package provides systemd service units for running the nosh service manager and daemontools service scanner under systemd, instead of running the nosh system manager.
 It presets systemd services that:
  * run the nosh service-manager server under systemd;
  * run the nosh service-dt-scanner (a.k.a. svscan) service under systemd; and
  * start the nosh normal.target and its dependencies.
 It disables the nosh sysinit.target, on the basis that systemd is doing that part of the work.
